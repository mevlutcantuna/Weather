## WEATHER APP
- The project can show the weather of the city you want.
- I got data from [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- I used [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to get data from [the Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## SETUP

To setup the project, run the following on your terminal in the order: 

```
git clone https://github.com/mevlutcantuna/Weather
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
